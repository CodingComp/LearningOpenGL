This repo is me following the University of Utah's Computer Graphics program online found here: https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2022. 

Here Cem Yuksel has online videos covering Computer Graphics. Talking about the different aspects of computer graphics such as transformations, normals, raytracing & more. All of the course videos are done in OpenGL & GLUT API. 

My goal is to get a good understanding of computer graphics, allowing myself to write shaders for any tasks that requires rendering.

This repo uses OpenGL with GLFW API.
